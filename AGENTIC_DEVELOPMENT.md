# pipreqs for Agentic Code Development

## How pipreqs Benefits AI-Powered Development

### 1. **Accurate Dependency Detection for AI Agents**

When AI agents work on Python projects, they need to understand dependencies accurately:

```python
# AI agent creates new code:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# pipreqs automatically detects: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
# Not the hundreds of packages in the environment
```

**Benefit**: AI agents can confidently add new imports knowing pipreqs will capture only what's actually used.

### 2. **Clean Context for AI Understanding**

Traditional `pip freeze` output:
```
# 200+ packages including:
alabaster==0.7.13
babel==2.13.1
certifi==2023.11.17
charset-normalizer==3.3.2
... (197 more)
```

pipreqs output:
```
# Only what's used:
pandas==2.0.3
numpy==1.24.3
scikit-learn==1.3.0
```

**Benefit**: AI agents work with minimal, relevant dependency lists - reducing token usage and improving accuracy.

### 3. **Enables Incremental Development**

AI agents can:
1. Add new functionality with imports
2. Run pipreqs to update requirements
3. Verify only intended dependencies were added

```bash
# AI adds new feature
echo "from transformers import pipeline" >> ml_module.py

# Update requirements
pipreqs --force .

# AI can verify: only 'transformers' was added
```

### 4. **System Package Detection Integration**

The new system package detection helps AI agents understand deployment contexts:

```python
# AI can now suggest:
"numpy and scipy can be installed via apt for better performance"
"black and flake8 should be installed with pipx as dev tools"
```

### 5. **Better Error Handling for AI Workflows**

With `--ignore-errors` flag, AI agents can:
- Continue working even with syntax errors
- Generate partial requirements during development
- Handle work-in-progress code gracefully

### 6. **Performance Benchmarking for AI Optimization**

The pytest-benchmark integration allows AI to:
- Measure performance impacts of changes
- Optimize code with confidence
- Track performance regressions

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: AI Building a New Feature

```python
# AI Agent receives request: "Add data visualization to the dashboard"

# 1. AI writes new code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def create_dashboard():
    # ... implementation

# 2. AI runs pipreqs:
# $ pipreqs --force .

# 3. AI commits with confidence:
# "Added visualization features - dependencies: matplotlib, seaborn"
```

### Scenario 2: AI Cleaning Up Legacy Code

```bash
# AI can identify unused dependencies:
pipreqs --diff requirements.txt .
pipreqs --clean requirements.txt .

# AI report: "Removed 15 unused dependencies, reducing Docker image by 200MB"
```

### Scenario 3: Multi-Agent Collaboration

```bash
# Agent 1 works on backend/
pipreqs backend/ --savepath backend/requirements.txt

# Agent 2 works on ml/
pipreqs ml/ --savepath ml/requirements.txt

# Orchestrator agent merges without conflicts
# Each component has minimal, accurate dependencies
```

### Scenario 4: AI-Driven Dependency Security

```python
# AI can analyze minimal dependencies:
requirements = pipreqs.get_all_imports(".")
for package in requirements:
    # Check security vulnerabilities
    # Suggest updates only for actual dependencies
    # Not hundreds of transitive dependencies
```

## Integration with AI Development Tools

### Claude Code Integration

```bash
# In CLAUDE.md:
"Always run pipreqs after adding new imports"
"Use pipreqs --diff before committing"
"Prefer pipreqs over pip freeze for requirements"
```

### GitHub Copilot Workspace

```yaml
# .github/copilot-instructions.md
- Generate requirements.txt using pipreqs, not pip freeze
- Run pipreqs --force after adding new dependencies
- Use pipreqs --clean to remove unused dependencies
```

### AI Code Review

```python
# AI reviewer can check:
def review_pr(pr_files):
    if "requirements.txt" in pr_files:
        # Run pipreqs --diff to verify changes match imports
        # Flag any suspicious additions
        # Suggest --mode compat for better compatibility
```

## Benefits Summary

| Aspect | Traditional Approach | With pipreqs | AI Agent Benefit |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Dependency List | 200+ packages | 5-20 packages | 90% less context to process |
| Accuracy | Includes unused | Only imported | Precise dependency tracking |
| Token Usage | High | Low | More efficient AI operations |
| Error Handling | Fails on syntax | --ignore-errors | Continuous development flow |
| Performance | No insights | Benchmarking | AI can optimize confidently |
| System Packages | Not detected | Auto-categorized | Smarter deployment strategies |

## Best Practices for AI Agents

1. **Always Incremental**: Run pipreqs after each feature addition
2. **Verify Changes**: Use --diff to confirm dependency modifications  
3. **Clean Regularly**: Use --clean to maintain minimal dependencies
4. **Benchmark Performance**: Use pytest-benchmark for optimization
5. **Document Choices**: AI should explain why specific packages are needed

## Future Enhancements for Agentic Development

1. **API Mode**: Direct Python API for AI agents to call
2. **Dependency Graph**: Visualize import relationships
3. **Security Integration**: Automatic vulnerability checking
4. **Version Recommendation**: AI-friendly version selection
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic handling of version conflicts

## Conclusion

pipreqs transforms dependency management from a manual, error-prone process to an automated, accurate one - perfect for AI agents that need to:
- Work with minimal context
- Make precise changes
- Maintain clean codebases
- Optimize performance
- Deploy efficiently

This makes pipreqs an essential tool in the agentic development toolchain.
